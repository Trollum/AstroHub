# AstroHub
First version of my AstroHub. This repo contains eagle PCB files, ready to upload Arduino sketch and source files for GUI.
Device is controlled by Arduino Nano board. On PCB there are 2 slots for LM2596 Step-Down regulator, output on the left one should by set to 5V, the right one is your choice.
Application to controll AstroHub can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/astrohub/
