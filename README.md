AstroHub
==================
 First version of my AstroHub. This repo contains eagle PCB files, ready to upload Arduino sketch and source files for GUI.
 
 Device is controlled by Arduino Nano board. There are 2 slots on PCB for LM2596 Step-Down regulator, output on the left one should by set to 5V, the right one you can set as you need.
 
 Application to controll AstroHub can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/astrohub/
 
APT
==================
 APT 3.00 with connected AstroHub shows temperature, humidity and dew point, when DHT22 sensor is connected.
